# Admin Dashboard

- You work at a startup that is building an interface for admins to see and delete users. The users will be provided via an API. Your job is to build out a working UI. See image below for reference.
- Note - this is for reference only. You don't need to build the exact same UI.

### These are the requirements :

1. Column titles must stand out from the entries.
2. There should be a search bar that can filter on any property.
3. You should be able to edit or delete rows in place.(There is no expectation of persistence. Edit and delete are expected to only happen in memory.)
4. You need to implement pagination: Each page contains 10 rows. Buttons at the bottom allow you to jump to any page including special buttons for first page, previous page, next page and last page. Pagination must update based on search/filtering. If there are 25 records for example that match a search query, then pagination buttons should only go till 3.
5. You should be able to select one or more rows. A selected row is highlighted with a grayish background color. Multiple selected rows can be deleted at once using the 'Delete Selected' button at the top right bin icon.
6. Checkbox on the top left is a shortcut to select or deselect all displayed rows. This should only apply to the ten rows displayed in the current page, and not all 50 rows.
7. Search box placeholder text should start with Search.
8. Search icon/button should have class as search-icon OR trigger search on ENTER.
9. Action element must be a button with a specific class name like edit, delete, save.
10. Navigation elements must be a div/button, and should have class name as first-page, previous-page, next-page and last-page and page numbers should be mentioned accordingly.
11. On clicking edit action in a row, it should be editable in the row itself.
12. feel free to use any libraries.
13. On executing, your application should be running successfully on deployed on vercel, netlify or any similar platform. 
14. after completing deployment. please submit [here](https://forms.gle/XAhSahQMFBayF6gq7).

**Note** :
The users are sorted by `id` field. There is no alphabetical sorting.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
